## Description

For this coding challenge I have made the following assumptions:

- `On-DutyDurationMS` was chosen as 'working time' for the purposes of calculating pay, overtime, and compliance
- All `dutyStatusDuration` times provided in the data are assumed to be contiguous rather than a sum of distinct values throughout the day
